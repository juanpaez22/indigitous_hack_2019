            One with God the Lord Most High
            Your hidden glory in creation
            Now revealed in You our Christ
            
            What a beautiful Name it is
            What a beautiful Name it is
            The Name of Jesus Christ my King
            
            What a beautiful Name it is
            Nothing compares to this
            What a beautiful Name it is
            The Name of Jesus
            
            You didn't want heaven without us
            So Jesus, You brought heaven down
            My sin was great, Your love was greater
            What could separate us now
            
            What a wonderful Name it is
            What a wonderful Name it is
            The Name of Jesus Christ my King
            
            What a wonderful Name it is
            Nothing compares to this
            What a wonderful Name it is
            The Name of Jesus
            What a wonderful Name it is
            The Name of Jesus
            
            Death could not hold You, the veil tore before You
            You silenced the boast of sin and grave
            The heavens are roaring the praise of Your glory
            For You are raised to life again
            
            You have no rival, You have no equal
            Now and forever, God, You reign
            Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the glory
            Yours is the Name above all names
            
            What a powerful Name it is
            What a powerful Name it is
            The Name of Jesus Christ my King
            
            What a powerful Name it is
            Nothing can stand against
            What a powerful Name it is
            The Name of Jesus
            
            You have no rival, You have no equal
            Now and forever, God, You reign
            Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the glory
            Yours is the Name above all names
            
            What a powerful Name it is
            What a powerful Name it is
