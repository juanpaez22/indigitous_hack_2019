People
Come together
Strange as neighbors
Our blood is one
Children
Of generations
Of every nation
Of kingdom come
Don't let your heart be troubled
Hold your head up high
Don't fear no evil
Fix your eyes on this one truth
God is madly in love with you
Take courage
Hold on
Be strong
Remember where our help comes from
Jesus
Our redemption
Our salvation
Is in His blood
Jesus
Light of heaven
Friend forever
His kingdom come
Swing wide
All you heavens
Let the praise go up
As the walls come down
All creation
Everything with breath
Repeat the sound
All His children
Clean hands
Pure hearts
Good grace
Good God
His Name is Jesus
