Come alive, come alive, come alive dry bones
Come alive, come alive, come alive dry bones
Awake,  arise
Inhale the light
Come alive,  come alive
I'm gonna sing to you dry bones
Until you're covered in life
And the valleys bloom
Like a rosebud in the light
Hear the call to attention
Feel the change in the air
For the ground is dry
But the clouds are overhead
I'm gonna sing it again
Come alive, come alive, come alive dry bones
Come alive, come alive, come alive dry bones
Awake,  arise
Inhale the light
Come alive,  come alive
Are you waiting on heaven
Or is it waiting on you
For the Holy Ghost is already in the room
So you better get ready
'Cause who knows what He'll do
Where the four winds blow there's a
Breakthrough, breaking through
And I'ma prophesi- again
Come alive, come alive, come alive dry bones
Come alive, come alive, come alive dry bones
Awake,  arise
Inhale the light
Come alive,  come alive
Come alive, alive
Get up and rise, rise
So leave those shackles in the grave now
And dance like you were young
You did not have to live in chains now
There's a key within your song
So leave the past where it belongs child
And take a leap into the Light
Come find the freedom you were born for
And tell that soul to rise
Arise, arise, arise
Get up and rise, rise
I'll sing it again
Come alive, come alive, come alive dry bones
Come alive, come alive, come alive dry bones
Awake,  arise
Inhale the light
Come alive,  come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive
Up from the ashes
A new life is born
Up from the ashes
Flesh on the bone
